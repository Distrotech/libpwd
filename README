libwpd is a library for import of WordPerfect documents. It is used by,
for example, AbiWord and LibreOffice.

libwpd requires librevenge and doxygen (optional) to build. Most up to
date code is available from Git repository at sourceforge.net
(http://sourceforge.net/p/libwpd/code/). See
http://sourceforge.net/p/libwpd/ for more information.

To build and install, simply do:
./autogen.sh # only needed if built from git checkout
./configure
make
su -c 'make install'

Alternatively, there are workspaces for various versions of MSVC in build/win32/
directory. Each of these workspaces contains a projects file to compile a
release version or a debug version of librevenge.

NOTE: Using the MSVC build system will result in a static library only. No dll
can be created yet using this build system.

The library is available under MPL 2.0 or LGPL 2.1+.
